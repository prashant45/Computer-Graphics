                <task title="Transformation of Normals" points=1 submitfile="Basic1.js">
                    <p>
                        In the fourth exercise, you learned about linear transformations such as scaling, rotation and shearing. Now you know the
                        matrices needed to transform objects (for example the rectangle showed in the leftmost picture), it is time to consider
                        the effect of linear transformations to the objects' normals which are needed for shading.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The picture in the middle shows both the rectangle and the edge normals transformed with the same linear transformation,
                        a shearing operation along the x axis. Obviously, the normals lose their defining behaviour when transformed with the
                        shearing transformation: They are not perpendicular to the edges anymore.
                    </p>
                    <canvas class="floatRight" id="canvasBasic1" width=600 height=200 data-call="Basic1.start" data-call-src="./BasicScripts/Basic1.js">
                        <img class="wait">
                    </canvas>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, in order to transform normals correctly, you need to set up a new linear transformation stored in the so-called
                        normal matrix. Find the creation of the normal matrix in the lecture, implement it
                        in <code>Basic1.js</code> and achieve correct normals in the rightmost picture.
                    </p>

                <task title="Phong Lighting" points=2 submitfile="Basic2.js">
                    <p>
                        Phong Lighting approximates the illumination of a surface point $p$ seen from a position $eye$,
                        assuming that the perceived color of the surface point is composed out of an ambient part,
                        which tries to model the indirect light from the environment, a diffuse part and a specular part.
                        Below you see the $eye$, the position of the point light source ($light$) and the surface.
                        The surface is sampled at certain points. You can set a user specific sample using the left mouse button.
                        Your task is to implement the Phong Lighting, therefore you have to implement the function <code>PhongLighting()</code>.
                        Note: The light emitted from the light source is assumed to be white so that you can
                        ignore the terms $I_{amb}$ and $I_{in}$ in the Phong formulae.

                <task title="Shading" points=2 submitfile="Basic2.js">
                    <p>
                        As you know from the lecture, there are several shading methods.
                        These methods describe ways to compute the color of illuminated surfaces.
                        In this task we will have a look at Flat Shading and Gouraud Shading.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Flat shading is the most simple method. It computes one color for one primitive (line in 2D, triangle in 3D).
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In contrast, Gouraud Shading computes the color at the vertices and interpolates the color linearly over the primitives.

                        In this task, you should implement Phong Lighting on a 3D terrain. The Phong Lighting model consists of three terms: the ambient,
                        diffuse and specular term. Right now, the terrain is only shaded with the constant ambient term, which results in an image difficult
                        to interpret: Every pixel of the terrain has the same color and you can hardly see the two hills and the two valleys of the terrain.
                        It is your task to add diffuse and specular term to make the scene look more realistic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike in the last task, you should not perform Flat or Gouraud Shading: To make the hills and valleys look good, you should 
                        implement Phong Shading. Therefore, you should not interpolate colors, but normals and positions. Using them in the fragment 
                        shader for lighting computations, you can determine colors on a per-fragment basis.

                            Follow the instructions in <code>shader_phong.vs</code> and <code>shader_phong.fs</code> to
                            produce the diffuse part of the illumination. Once you are done, you will be able to recognize the
                            hills and valleys by the illumination changes when the light source moves over the terrain.

                            Follow the instructions in <code>shader_phong.fs</code> to produce the specular part of the illumination.
                            Once you are done, you can experiment with this view-dependent part of the illumination. Use the keys A
                            and D to turn around the camera and see how the specular reflections move. This effect can be observed
                            better when the light source movement is turned off. You can control the shininess of the surface by using
                            the slider.
