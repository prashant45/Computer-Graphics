            <exercise prefix="Basic Exercises" title="Affine Transformations - Solar System" points=10>
                An affine transformation in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by a $n\times n$-matrix  $\mathbf{A}$ and a vector $\vec{t}$:
                $$ f(x) = \mathbf{A}\vec{x} + \vec{t} $$
                $\mathbf{A}$ is called the <b>linear part</b> and $\vec{t}$ is called the <b>translational part</b> of $f$.

                            In this task we want to implement some basic linear transformations (transformations with $\vec{t} = 0$),
                            i.e. rotation, scaling and shearing. The corresponding functions can be found in
                            <code>Basic1_1</code>.

                            A rotation transformation can be substituted by a series of shear transformations:

                        <p>
                            Given two affine transformations $f_1$  and $f_2$
                            with linear parts $\mathbf{A}_1$,
                            $\mathbf{A}_2$ and translation vectors $\vec{t}_1$, $\vec{t}_2$ respectively, the composition $f_2 \circ f_1$ is also affine:
                            $$f_1(x) = A_1x + \vec{t}_1 \text{ and } f_2(x) = A_2x +\vec{t}_2 \Rightarrow (f_2 \circ f_1)(x) = A_{1,2}x + \vec{t}_{1,2}$$
                            Determine its linear part $A_{1,2}$ and its translation vector $\vec{t}_{1,2}$.

                            Implement the corresponding formula in the function <code>Basic1_3.CompositeAffineTransformations()</code>.
                            Below you see from left to right the input triangle, the triangle transformed with $f_1$, the triangle transformed with $f_1$ and $f_2$ in succession and the input triangle transformed with the composition of both transformations.
                            Note that the two rightmost triangle images should be the same.

                    <subtask title="Affine Mapping" points=2>
                        <p>
                            In the following we consider the two-dimensional case $(n=2$).
                            Given three points
                            $$P_0=[a_0, b_0], \quad P_1=[a_1, b_1], \quad P_2=[a_2, b_2],$$
                            show that there is a unique affine mapping $f$ such that
                            $$
                            f([0,0])= P_0, \qquad f([1,0])= P_1, \qquad f([0,1])= P_2
                            $$
                            and determine its linear part and its translation vector.

                            Using this mapping you can transform the unit triangle (with the vertices $[1,0]$, $[0,1]$, $[0,0]$) to an arbitrary other triangle (with vertices $P_0$, $P_1$, $P_2$).
                            Implement the formula in <code>Basic1_4.ComputeMapping()</code>.
                            The result is shown below. On the left you see the unit triangle and on the right the target triangle. In the middle you see the transformed unit triangle.

                    <p>
                        From the first exercise you know that an affine transformation has the form:
                        $$ f(x) = \mathbf{A}\vec{x} + \vec{t} $$
                        Thus, the transformation consists of a multiplication and an addition.
                        We now reformulate the transformation to:
                        $$ \hat{f}(x) = \left( \begin{array}{c} f(x) \\ 1 \end{array} \right) = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} \mathbf{A} & \vec{t} \\ {\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 0 \end{array}} & 1 \end{array} \right] \left( \begin{array}{c} \vec{x} \\ 1 \end{array} \right)$$
                        As can be seen, by lifting the coordinates from 2D to 3D, we can represent the affine transformation as a linear transformation.
                        The new coordinate $\left( \begin{array}{c} \vec{x} \\ 1 \end{array} \right)$ is called homogeneous coordinate.
                        For this task we want you to work in homogeneous coordinates.
                        The composition of two affine transformations in homogeneous coordinates is a simple matrix-matrix multiplication of the corresponding matrices.
                        Have a look at the vertex shader <code>shader_default.vs</code> to see how the transformation is applied.

                        In this task you are asked to implement the rotation and translation of the luminaries in a solar system.
                        Note that some luminaries rotate around others resulting in a hierarchical structure.
                        A luminary consists of several attribute like its radius, the radius of the orbit, the color and the shader program used to draw the luminary.
                        The most important attributes are the <code>luminary.speed</code> value which specifies the rotational speed of the luminary around the parent object
                        and the <code>luminary.modelMatrix</code> which places the luminary relatively to the parent object in space.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are asked to implement the recursive <code>Basic2.drawLuminary()</code> function.
                        The function is called with the root of the solar system - the sun (see <code>drawScene()</code>).
                        For each luminary, you have to concatenate three matrices:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            the rotation matrix that rotates the luminary around its parent object - This one has to be set up by you.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the matrix that places the luminary with respect to the parent object in space - This one is stored in <code>luminary.modelMatrix</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the parent model matrix - This one is given as an argument (<code>modelMatrixParent</code>).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        First set up the rotation matrix. Next, concatenate the three matrices together - be careful with the order!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The computed transformation is used to draw the luminary using a shader similar to the one that you have already implemented in the last exercise sheet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, you have to call the <code>drawLuminary()</code> function recursively for each child, passing on the computed model matrix.
                    </p>

                            The parameter <code>rotationalSpeedAroundParentAxis</code> gives the rotational speed of a luminary around its parent object.
                            The parameter <code>rotationalSpeedAroundOwnAxis</code> gives the rotational speed of a luminary around its own axis.
                            Note that the parameter <code>rotationalSpeedAroundOwnAxis</code> should only have influence on the rotation of the corresponding luminary, but not on the child objects!

                            As you might have already seen, the shader program for the sun is different to the shader program for the earth and the moon.
                            In this task you are asked to implement a nice sun shader.
                            First of all we want to add some glowing to the sun.
                            As in the previous exercise sheets, we compute the distance from every pixel to the center of the circle.
                            If the pixel is outside the inner radius (<code>uniform radius</code>) but inside the corona of the sun (<code>3*radius</code>),
                            we want to add some "glowing".
                            Instead of a linear falloff that we used in the previous exercise sheets to compute an alpha value, we want to use a falloff defined by:
                            $\alpha_{glow}(s) = s^6$.
                            Here, $s$ is the distance of a pixel to the surface of the circle.
                            You should now see a glowing sun.

                            To improve the visual result, we now add some sunrays.
                            The intensity of a sunray is generated using procedural noise.
                            We already provide a suitable random number function <code>noiseDir()</code>.
                            This function takes a 2D direction and the current global time (use <code>uniform time</code>) as input.
                            For a single pixel we first determine the ray on which it lies (if the pixel is inside the corona).
                            Using this direction and the global time we can use the <code>noiseDir()</code> function to compute the intensity of this ray $I_{ray}$.
                            The intensity of the ray falls off with the distance to the surface of the sun.
                            Use a quadratic falloff.
                            Thus, the alpha value for a sunray that goes to the pixel is computed by:
                            $\alpha_{ray}(dir, time, s) = s^2 * noiseDir(dir,time)$.
                            At the end we add both alpha values and draw the pixel with the sun color and the computed alpha value.

                        <p>
                            In this task we want to use the provided procedural noise generator to texture the earth and the moon.
                            The random texture has to be static for a luminary, i.e. it should not change in time.
                            In contrast to the rays of the previous assignment, every texel should get another value.
                            Thus, the function <code>noiseDir(dir,time)</code> has to be called with a constant time (e.g. 0) and the texture coordinate (<code>vTex</code>).
                            The return value is used as a linear weight between the two colors that are assigned to the fragment shader (<code>color0</code> and <code>color1</code>).
