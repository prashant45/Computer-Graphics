                        <p>
                            From AlgoKS you already know bilinear interpolation.
                            Bilinear interpolation is very important in the context of textures.
                            We want you to implement the bilinear sampling method <code>Basic0.sampleBilinear</code>.
                            Follow the instructions in the source code. Make use of the given helper functions.

                        <p>
                            This assigment is about <b>MIP Mapping</b>.
                            The first task is to build the MIP map pyramid.
                            Follow the instructions in the constructor <code>MipMap(texture1D, nLevelMax)</code>.
                            After implementation you should see the level below the surface in the canvas below.
                            We now want to use the MIP map pyramid to set the colors of the pixels in the image plane.
                            Currently we always use the finest level of the pyramid.
                            You have to adapt the code in <code>Render()</code> accordingly (see <code>TODO</code>).
                            The idea is to compute the footprint of a pixel in the texture.
                            If the footprint is larger than the texel size of a level, we want to use a coarser level.
                            The footprint of a pixel can be computed by the distance of the top and bottom texture coordinate of the pixel (These coordinates are already computed, see comments in the source code!).

                    <p>
                        This assignment will give you a look at perspective contortion and its consequences for rasterization.
                        A triangle $\Delta ABC$ with $A = (0, 0, -1)^T$, $B = (0, 2, -3)^T$ and $C = (-2, -1, -3)^T$ is given.
                        This triangle contains another triangle which consists of the centers of the edges $AB$, $BC$ and $CA$.
                        Furthermore, a projection matrix $M$ is given which transforms $\Delta ABC$ such that $A'$ lies at the near plane and $B'$ and $C'$ lie on the far plane.
                        $$

                    <p>
                        In this task, you should texture a plane, first with a texture containing colors, second with a texture
                        containing normals. Right now, you look at the plane (which is colored grey) from the top. You can change
                        the viewing angle using the <code>W</code> and <code>S</code> keys. There is a point light source hovering
                        over the plane, like in the Phong shading task of Basic Exercises 6.
                    </p>
                    <subtask title="Texture Mapping" points="2" submitfile="Basic3.js, shader_texture.vs, shader_texture.fs">
                        <img class="floatRight" id="checkerboard_show" width="150" height="150" src='./resources/checkerboard.png' />
                        <p>
                            On the right, you see a checkerboard texture. Several steps are needed to apply this texture
                            to the plane.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Set up the texture from the provided image.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    In the vertex shader you can find an attribute for the texture coordinates. Define a varying
                                    variable to pass them to the fragment shader. Assign the attribute to the varying variable.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    In the fragment shader, define the same varying variable to receive the texture coordinates
                                    from the vertex shader. Define a uniform sampler holding the texture to be passed, and sample
                                    the texture at the texture coordinates.
                                </li>
                                
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once the texture is set up correctly, you see the texture in the upper left corner of the plane,
                            where the texture coordinates are smaller than $1$. To repeat the texture for texture coordinates greater than $1$ rather than clamping 
                            it to the nearest value, you can check the associated checkbox. Have a look at <code>onChangeRepeat()</code> 
                            to see how it works.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As soon as repeating is enabled, the texture covers the entire plane. When you change 
                            the view angle, however, minification occurs in areas farther away, and ugly patterns arise.
                            To change this, enable MIP mapping by checking the associated checkbox. Have a look at <code>onChangeMipmap()</code>
                            to see how it works.
                        </p>
                    </subtask>
                    <subtask title="Normal Mapping" points="2" submitfile="Basic3.js, shader_texture.fs">
                        <img class="floatRight" id="cobblestone_show" width="150" height="150" src='./resources/cobblestone.png' />
                        <p>
                            A texture can also be used to store additional information of a surface, such as normals. On the right,
                            you see a so-called normal map which stores normals encoded as RGB triplets. Once these normals are used
                            for lighting computation in the fragment shader, the plane does not look flat anymore, but as if covered with
                            cobblestone. Find the appropriate <code>TODO</code>s in the two submission files and apply the normal
                            map to the plane! You can reuse the texture coordinates already used in the first subtask.
                            Be aware of two things: First, the normals are stored as colors, which means that their values have
                            been mapped to $[0,1]$. You have to bring them back to $[-1,1]$ to use the normals. Second, unlike in the last
                            subtask, the plane should be covered with one single, unrepeated instance of the texture. Therefore, you have
                            to change the texture coordinates to be in range $[0,1]$ rather than $[0,width]$ and $[0,height]$, respectively 
                            ($width$ and $height$ are given in the uniform <code>planeSize</code>!).
