                        <p>
                            In this task you are asked to implement an orthogonal projection in 2D.
                            Assume that the camera is aligned with the global coordinate system.
                            The projection maps the 2D geometry onto a 1D line (the image plane).
                            You have to implement <code>Basic1_1.OrthogonalProjection2D(point2D)</code>.
                            As an argument, it gets a 2D point that has to be projected onto the image plane. The function returns the 1D coordinate on the image plane.

                        <p>
                            In this task you are asked to implement a perspective projection in 2D.
                            Assume that the camera is aligned with the global coordinate system.
                            The projection maps the 2D geometry onto a 1D line (the image plane).
                            You have to implement <code>Basic1_2.PerspectiveProjection2D(eye, imagePlane, point2D)</code>.
                            In contrast to the previous assignment it also gets the position of the eye and the z-component of the image plane.
                            Before projecting the point, you have to transform the point into the camera space (orgin is the eye position, axis are aligned to the world coordinate system).
                            The function returns the 1D coordinate on the image plane.
                        </p>

                    <subtask title="Perspective Projection in Homogeneouse Coordinates" points="4">
                        <p>
                            From the previous assignment you know how a perspective projection works.
                            As you know from the lecture, a perspective projection can be easily applied using homogeneous coordinates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this task we have a freely movable camera.
                            You can use the mouse to set a new camera center (eye).
                            Using [ctrl] + mouse button you can change the point the camera looks at.
                            Your task is now to implement the required methods to set up the camera matrix, the inverse camera matrix and the perspective transformation matrix
                            (have a look at the <code>TODO</code>s in <code>Camera.prototype.update</code> and <code>mat3.perspective</code>).
                            The camera matrix transforms a point from world space to camera space.
                            The inverse camera matrix transforms a point from camera space to world space.
                            Finally, you have to project a point given in world space coordinates to the canonical volume.
                            Therefore, you have to implement the function <code>Camera.prototype.projectPoint</code>.

                <task title="Projections 3D" points=3 submitfile="Basic2.js">
                    <p>
                        In this task, you are asked to implement the 2D projection concept from the last task in 3D and set up a camera which projects the 3D space
                        into 2D. The canvas below is split: On the left side, you can see the projection result, i.e. the image seen from the camera. On the right
                        side, there is a debug view showing you both the observed scene (a colored cube in the middle of the coordinate system) and the frustum 
                        belonging to the camera.
                    </p>

                        </center>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The functions to be implemented are <code>Camera3D.prototype.update</code> and <code>mat4.perspective</code>, analogously to the two functions in 
                        5.1c. Find the appropriate <code>TODO</code>s in the code and add code for the creation of the two matrices needed: First, set up the camera matrix in 
                        <code>Camera3D.prototype.update</code>. Once you have completed this, you should see the camera frustum in the debug view on the right side. Second,
                        set up the projection matrix in <code>mat4.perspective</code>. Once this matrix is correct, you should see the camera output in the view on the left side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As soon as you have finished the creation of the two matrices, you can enable interaction with the camera through setting <code>enableInteraction</code> to <code>true</code>. 
                        You can move the camera within bounds, using the keys W (move camera forwards), S (move camera backwards), A (turn camera to the left) and D (turn camera to
                        the right). The camera is always oriented towards the origin and therefore towards the cube. The opening angle of the camera can be adjusted using the slider below the canvas.
                        The debug camera remains static during all of these changes so you can observe the effects on the camera frustum.
